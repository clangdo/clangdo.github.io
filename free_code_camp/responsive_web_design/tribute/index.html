	<h2>Why is binary important?</h2>
	<p>
	  Long ago computers were known as
	  "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">differencing
	  engines</a>" because they found the differences between
	  various inputs. In these first of computers the inputs and
	  outputs to the machine were all provided and manipulated by
	  ingenious mechanical contraptions. They used cams and cogs
	  and worm gears to perform mathematical operations on the
	  inputs, and spit them out in some readable form. With the
	  introduction of the transistor though, building mechanical
	  contraptions for every operation became more trouble than it
	  was worth. The transistor is a powerful tool because it
	  allows a circuit designer to switch a circuit on and off
	  with another circuit! Even early transistors quickly had the
	  advantage in size over their analog mechanical brethren. So
	  the digital computer was born.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Let's back up for a second, what does "digital" mean? It
	  means simply something based on digits! See? "Digit" is even
	  in the word <b>digit</b>al. It's often used to differentiate
	  computing devices and recording media from their "analog"
	  counterparts. So what does analog mean? It specifies
	  something mimics it's input naturally, with all the possible
	  states that input could have. You can see how the old
	  camshafts and cogs did that by watching this video:
	</p>
	<div class="video">

		  height="740"

		  allow="clipboard-write;
			 encrypted-media;
			 picture-in-picture"
		  allowfullscreen>
	</iframe>
	</div>
	<p>
	  But wait, if I have an analog computer that operates exactly
	  on my inputs, why is a digital computer that only
	  approximates them with numbers better? It all comes down to
	  size. Transistors are tiny (especially today), while gears
	  and cams are large by necessity. Remember, it's not just
	  that they have to work, it's also that they have to work for
	  a long time and not wear down too much! Plus it's far more
	  complex to route numbers around a mechanical assembly. You
	  saw that it was fairly easy to add two inputs together, but
	  think about adding hundreds! Pretty complex, right?
	</p>
	<p>
	  Okay but what does this have to do with binary? Well the
	  transistor is basically a switch, it's either on or off, and
	  while detecting and creating more possible voltages on the
	  wire is doable, the pair of digit values (0 and 1) that are
	  possible in binary naturally fit the "on/off" state of a
	  single transistor. If you put multiple transistors together
	  then you can just treat them individually as binary digits!
	  And that paves the way for you to represent any number
	  expressible with the digits (transistors) you have
	  available!
	</p>
	<p>
	  So without binary, computers may never have moved past their
	  gargantuan mechanical antecedents, and you might not be able
	  to read this right now!

	<h2>So how does it work?</h2>
	<p>
	  The easiest way to explain binary is to show you! So that's
	  what I'll do. Below, you can see the way a base two (binary)
	  number is a lot like our base ten numbers that we use all the
	  time.
	</p>

	<h3>A base ten primer</h3>
	<p> First let's look at how a "normal" number looks, and break
	  it down. This might remind you of a class you took really
	  early on, where you first learned about the place values for
	  numbers! The number I'm looking at is 1,423, which happens to
	  be the first prime number with 1, 2, 3, and 4 among its
	  digits.
	</p>
	<div class="breakdown-container">
	  <div class="number-breakdown decimal">
	    <p>1</p> <sp></sp> <p>4</p> <sp></sp> <p>2</p> <sp></sp> <p>3</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <p>10<sup>3</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>10<sup>2</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>10<sup>1</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>10<sup>0</sup></p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <p>1000</p> <p>+</p> <p>400</p> <p>+</p> <p>20</p> <p>+</p> <p>3</p> <p>=</p> <p>1423</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<p>
	  See? In order to get to a base ten number, we multiply
	  each digit by the <it>power</it> of ten that corresponds to
	  its place value. Then we add all the results up! You probably
	  do this intuitively by now whenever you think of a number, but
	  believe it or not you once had to learn how to do this!
	</p>
	<h3>The binary 'b'</h3>
	<p>
	  Now let's look at a binary number and see how it can convey
	  the same thing. We'll convert it to base 10 so you can see
	  that the numbers are the same. The binary number will be the
	  ASCII code for the character 'b' in honor of
	  binary. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii">ASCII</a>
	  is a standard way of representing characters with numbers. It
	  says 'b' is the number 110&nbsp;0010 (The separation every four
	  digits is just for readability, kinda like the comma every
	  three digits in decimal). Anyway, let's see if we can tell
	  what this is in decimal by applying a similar technique to
	  above.
	</p>
	<div class="breakdown-container">
	  <div class="number-breakdown binary">
	    <!-- row 1 -->
	    <p>1</p> <sp></sp> <p>1</p> <sp></sp> <p>0</p> <sp></sp> <p>0</p> <sp></sp> <p>0</p> <sp></sp> <p>1</p> <sp></sp> <p>0</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <!-- row 2 -->
	    <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp>
	    <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <p>×</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <!-- row 3 -->
	    <p>2<sup>6</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>2<sup>5</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>2<sup>4</sup></p> <sp></sp>
	    <p>2<sup>3</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>2<sup>2</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>2<sup>1</sup></p> <sp></sp> <p>2<sup>0</sup></p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <!-- row 4 -->
	    <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp>
	    <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <p>=</p> <sp></sp> <sp></sp>
	    <!-- row 5 -->
	    <p>64</p> <p>+</p> <p>32</p> <p>+</p> <p>0</p> <p>+</p> <p>0</p> <p>+</p> <p>0</p> <p>+</p> <p>2</p> <p>+</p> <p>0</p> <p>=</p> <p>98</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<p>
	  So yeah, we need a lot more digits for a given number
	  because now each place value is multiplied by a power of
	  two, not ten, but it's not too bad, most modern processors
	  deal with numbers 32, 64, or even more digits long! These
	  numbers can get pretty big (up to 1×10<sup>19</sup> for 64
	  digit positive numbers, and that's a one with 19 zeroes
	  after it!).
