	  Hello literal world. This website is my personal open source
	  site for stuff. In particular it serves (will serve) as a
	  static showcase of my work, passions, opinions, and
	  occasionally complaints.

	  At this point you may have some questions.

	    <li>Who are you?</li>
	    <li>What are you doing on my computer screen?</li>
	    <li>How did I even get here?</li>
	    <li>What is the meaning of life?</li>
	</ul></nav>
	<p>
	  You should not ask me these since I simply
	  don't have answers for you.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point the only thing here is my solution to the first
	  of many projects on my web journey, which I completed for free
	  code camp. You can find that solution
