	  Hello literal world. This website is my personal open source
	  site for stuff. In particular it will serve as a
	  static showcase of my work, passions, opinions, and
	  occasionally complaints.
	</p>

	<p>
	  At this point you may have some questions.
	</p>
	<nav><ul class="inline-text-list">
	    <li>Who are you?</li>
	    <li>What is your website doing on my computer screen?</li>
	    <li>How did I even get here?</li>
	    <li>What is the meaning of life?</li>
	</ul></nav>
	<p>
	  You should not ask me these since I simply don't have
	  answers for you (yet). I probably will have some answers for
	  you at some point, for now I will let this serve as a simple
	  homepage with a simple link.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At this point the only thing here is my solution to the first
	  of many projects on my web journey, which I completed for free
	  code camp. You can find that solution
	  <a href="https://clangdo.com/free_code_camp/responsive_web_design/tribute/index.html">here</a>.
